# supervisedml

Purpose:

To create a code foor supervised machine learning that will help analyze loans from 2019 and 2020. 

*Data has already been adjusted using undersampling before actual coding began


Unscaled Data Prediction:
The Linear Regression model will do better than the Random Tree model due to the data being balanced potentially producing a better accuracy score

Unscaled Data Results:


Scaled Data Prediction:
At this point since the data will be scaled I believe the Random Tree model will do better since the scaling of the data may affect the balance of the data thus favoring the 
Random Tree model but this goes on the assumption that the data is affected in a way that would alter how it has been set before.

Scaled Data Results:
